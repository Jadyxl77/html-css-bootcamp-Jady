<h1>The Facts of Life</h1>

<div>

    <p>The second mark of existence is egolessness. As human beings we are as impermanent as everthing else is. Evercell in the body is continuously changing. Thoughts and emotions rise and fall away unceasingly. When we are thinking that we are competent or that we are hopeless.</p>
