This alll happens out of ignorance-ifgnorance of our interconnectedness with each other and of our own basic goodness. But now, instaed of beating yourselfg up for lising it, you can aspire to be moreaware of your own hurtful actions and more aware of how wiedes spreasd thee kinds of actions are in the world. </p>
